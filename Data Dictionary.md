## New York Times daily COVID case data
- Link: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data 
- This data was used to collect daily COVID case totals in the five states of our study. We took the total county case numbers and summed them to get per-day state totals. We then used the total case numbers to calculate daily new cases (by subtracting yesterday’s total cases from today’s total), then daily total recovered cases (summing over all new cases up until two weeks ago), and finally daily totals of infected individuals (difference between today’s total cases and today’s recovered cases).

## CDC Vaccine

- This data was used in the second part of this analysis to provide greater context to COVID infection rates in the state of California. Our group analyzed a few variables (movement data, masking restrictions, etc.) but found this data from the CDC to be the most reliable and comprehensive.

## Covid-19 Mobility
