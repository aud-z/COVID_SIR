# COVID_SIR
Simulation of the COVID-19 Infectionusness Rate Change

## Jupiter Notebook
There are 6 Jupiter Notebook in this repository. 
### For the part 1 calculation, the following 5 files should be run.

- Part 1_WA.ipynb
- Part1_CA.ipynb
- Part1_FL.ipynb
- Part_1_HI.ipynb
- part_1_TX.ipynb

We use 'us-counties.csv' and 'us-states.csv' data for part 1, and these csv files has to be in the same directory with the above jupiter notebooks. You can execute the 5 jupiter notebooks in any order.
Also, the date - R_0_e graph is shown in the last part of Part1_FL.ipynb.


### For the part 2 calculation, the following file should be run.
- CA_SIR_Ext_Vax_Fatality.ipynb

We use 'us-states.csv', 'vax_data.csv', 'COVID-19_Vaccination_Trends_in_the_United_States_National_and_Jurisdictional.csv' and '2021_US_Region_Mobility_Report.csv'. They have to be in the same directory with the above jupiter notebook.<br>
Also, '2021_US_Region_Mobility_Report.csv' is too huge to include the github repository, so we included '2021_US_Region_Mobility_Report.zip' in this repository. When you use the file, you have to unzip it and include the csv file in the same directory with 'CA_SIR_Ext_Vax_Fatality.ipynb' file.
